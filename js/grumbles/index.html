<h1> All my grumbles </h1> <!-- this is like a partial in rails. This is so that we don't have to write a lot of text inside templateURL in app.js function RouterFunction -->

<div data-ng-repeat="grumble in GrumbleIndexViewModel.grumbles | orderBy: '-created_at'"> <!-- this orders grumbles by the date they were created. A filter. -->
  <!-- to print out the grumbles variable from main index.html page need to do a data-ng-repeat. GrumbleIndexViewModel comes from 'controller as' in index.html page-->
   <p><a data-ui-sref="grumbleShow({id: grumble.id})">{{grumble.title}}</a></p> <!-- prints out each title from the API. s in sref stands for state since it is a link to a state. ALSO, grumbleShow is creating a link to the show page. id: is referring to the id: in the url: "/grumbles/:id"-->

<button><a data-ui-sref="grumbleEdit({id: grumble.id})">Edit</a></button>
  <!-- prints out an edit for each title -->
